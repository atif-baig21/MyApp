The Lorm alphabet is a method of tactile signing named after Hieronymus Lorm, who developed it in the late 19th century. Letters are spelled by tapping or stroking different parts of the listener's hand.[1] The Lorm alphabet is mostly used in German-speaking countries, the Netherlands, Czech Republic, Poland and Georgia.
